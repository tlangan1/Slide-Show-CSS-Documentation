                Placing the style element in the head as follows alows you to
                edit CSS in the browser right on the page you are using. You
                don’t have to open the browser tools to do so.
                <pre>
                  <code>
            &lt;style contenteditable="true"&gt;
                head,
                style {
                    display: block;
                }
            &lt;/style&gt;
                  </code>
                </pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                Estelle alludes to a template known as html 5 boilerplate but
                points out that in the long version a very good explanation of
                HTML 5 exists. I should look into this.
              </li>
              <li>
                In viewing the course, I ran into a concept known as the shadow
                DOM. This is not at all new and is used extensively in custom
                elements. It allows the author to attach a DOM tree to a node in
                the DOM that does not interact with the rest of the DOM in any
                way.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you position something absolutely it is positioned relative
                to the first ancestor that is positioned. So, in practice, it is
                often the case that the parent of something positioned
                absolutely is positioned:relative.
              </li>
              <li>
                The at rules of CSS like @media or @font-face are CSS statements
                that instruct CSS how to behave.

                &lt;script defer&gt; for inline javascript and &lt;script
                src=’javascript file.js’ defer&gt; for including a JavaScript
                file instructs the browser that the script is to be downloaded
                in parallel to parsing the page but not executed until after the
                page has finished parsing.

              <li style="column-count: 3; column-rule: thick inset blue" ;>
                The column-count property provides a way to break the content of
                an element up into n columns where n is the integer value of the
                column-count property. The column-rule property provides a way
                to style the space between the columns. See

                The three most common selectors are targeting by id, the hash #
                sign, targeting by class, the “.” and targeting by element name,
                for example p for paragraph.
              </li>
              <li>
                Descendent selector: For example, ul li targets all lis nested
                within a ul regardless of how far down the nesting may be. The
                space “ “ between the elements denotes this selector.
              </li>
              <li>
                Child selector: For example, ol > li, targets all lis that are
                direct children of an ol. The greater than sign “>” between the
                elements denotes this selector.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adjacent sibling: For example, li.myClass + li, targets any li
                immediately following in the mark-up of an li of class myClass.
                The plus sign “+” between the elements denotes this selector.
              </li>
              <li>
                General sibling selector: For example, li.myClass ~ li targets
                all lis following in the mark up an li of class myClass. The
                tilde “~” between the elements denotes this selector.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Simple attribute: For example, E[A] will target all E elements
                containing A attributes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attribute value: For exampler, E[A=”val”] will target all E
                elements containing A attributes that have the value “val”. In
                elements where the attribute value is case sensitive then the
                CSS selector is case sensitive otherwise not. This is denoted by
                the “=”.
              </li>
              <li>
                Note that the syntax “*=”, starts with, “$=” ends with and “*=”
                matches or contains are identical syntax to regular expressions.
