<h1 align="center">CSS Documentation in a Slide Show</h1>

- This project documents some aspects of CSS but, more importantly, provides a way to edit that CSS in the browser. This allows the user to experiment with the CSS concepts documented.

- A simple static site with a little JavaScript to give the appearance of Slide Show.

## TODOs

- Document more CSS features.
